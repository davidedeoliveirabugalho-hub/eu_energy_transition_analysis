# European Energy Transition Analysis

## 📖 Description

This project analyzes the European energy transition from 2015 to 2024, exploring how countries have evolved their electricity mix toward renewable sources and the factors influencing this transformation.

## 🎯 Objectives

This project aims to answer key questions about Europe's energy transition:

- **Energy Mix Evolution**: How has the share of renewable vs. fossil fuels changed across European countries?
- **Consumption Trends**: What are the patterns in electricity consumption by country and over time?
- **Transition Leaders**: Which countries are leading the renewable energy adoption?
- **Price Impact**: How do energy prices correlate with the energy mix composition?

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Data Ingestion**: Airbyte
- **Data Warehouse**: Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery)
- **Data Transformation**: dbt (data build tool)
- **Data Visualization**: Metabase
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Containerization**: Docker
